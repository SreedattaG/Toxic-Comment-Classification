# Toxic-Comment-Classification
This program detects toxic comments using deep learning. It processes text, uses GloVe embeddings, and trains a bidirectional LSTM model. If a model exists, it loads it; otherwise, it trains a new one. It then evaluates accuracy and visualizes results with a confusion matrix.
